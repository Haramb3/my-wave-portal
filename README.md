## MY WAVE PORTAL

This is my first Web3 project. I used solidity and javascript to code the smart contract and deploy it to the Rinkeby Testnet. HTML and CSS for the creation of the website:

Wave Machine is an smart contract that lets you wave at me. Waving consists on making transactions through the Ethereum testnet Rinkeby. Each wave stores an address, message and timestamp. As long as the Rinkeby testnet keeps running, those parameters will forever be saved in the blockchain, so be wise and text something nice!

By waving at me, you have a 50% chance of winning 0.0001 RinkEth. But beware, you can only wave me once every 15min, otherwise, the transaction fails.
